# Lego Coder - Virtual Programming Interface for LEGO Robotics

This is a virtual website for programming LEGO Mindstorms EV3 and LEGO SPIKE Prime robots. The website provides a high-tech blue screen interface where you can choose your robotics platform, create programs using block coding or Python, and generate downloadable code for your LEGO device.

## Features

- **Software Selection**: Choose between LEGO Mindstorms EV3 or LEGO SPIKE Prime
- **Dual Coding Modes**: 
  - Visual block coding with drag-and-drop interface
  - Python editor with syntax examples and quick reference
- **Hardware-Aware Interface**: Automatically adjusts instructions and references for EV3 brick or SPIKE Prime Hub
- **Code Generation**: Convert your block programs or Python code into downloadable `.py` files
- **USB Connection Simulation**: Simulated USB connection and device detection
- **Live Console Output**: Real-time feedback and program execution simulation

## How It Works

1. **Select Your Platform**: Choose LEGO Mindstorms EV3 or LEGO SPIKE Prime
2. **Create Your Program**: Use either block coding (drag and drop) or write Python code directly
3. **Generate Code**: Click "Generate Code" to convert your program into executable Python code
4. **Connect Your Device**: Follow on-screen instructions to connect your LEGO device via USB
5. **Download & Run**: Download the generated Python file and transfer it to your LEGO device to run your program

## Key Improvements

- **Hardware-Specific References**: The interface correctly references "EV3 brick" for Mindstorms and "SPIKE Prime Hub" for SPIKE Prime
- **Code Generation (Not File Upload)**: Instead of uploading files, the website generates Python code that you can download and transfer
- **Separate Python Editor**: Python coding mode is completely separate from block coding, with its own editor and tools

## Technology

- Built with HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript
- Responsive design with futuristic blue tech theme
- Drag-and-drop API for block programming
- Blob API for code download functionality
- Hosted on GitHub Pages

## Development

This is a work in progress. Future enhancements may include:
- More block types and categories
- Syntax highlighting for Python editor
- Program saving and loading
- Simulated robot preview
