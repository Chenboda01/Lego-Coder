This is a virtual website for a new style for LEGO Mindstorms EV3. It is a work in progress, and I will be adding more content as I go along. The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it is hosted on GitHub Pages. First when we open the page there will be a high tech blue screen that lets you choose if you want to use LEGO Mindstorms or LEGO Spike prime. Next, After we choose what software you are going to do you can code the stuff you want. After you do the coding it will ask you to connect a USB port to the EV3 brick. Once you connect the USB port it will ask you to select a code file to upload to you brick. Once you connected it you will see it on you brick. Once you run it, it will do the same thing as the code you uploaded. This is an easier way to code for the EV3 brick, and it is also a lot more fun to use. This website is accessable at https://chenboda01.github.io/Lego-Coder/
